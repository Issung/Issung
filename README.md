# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name's Issung :) 
* I'm a full time Senior Software Engineer building .NET Web APIs.
* I maintain a few open source projects, namely [PS2IODB](https://ps2iodb.com/), [GChan](https://github.com/Issung/GChan) & [SorterExpress](https://github.com/Issung/SorterExpress).
* I enjoy experimenting with game development, check out my Game Boy Advance game [*Gematrix*](https://issung.itch.io/gematrix)!
* Lots of ideas, not enough time.
